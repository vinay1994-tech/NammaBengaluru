    <p>Bangalore Palace is a royal palace located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, in an area that was owned by Rev. J. Garrett, the first principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now famous as Central College. The commencement of the construction of the palace is attributed to him.
The property was purchased from Rev. Garrett in 1873 at a cost of Rs. 40,000 by the British Guardians of the minor Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar 10 using his personal funds. They were in charge of his education and administrative training to ready him to take over his reign in 1881 AD. As the young Maharaja did not have a suitable place to stay during his training in Bengaluru, this property was purchased and transformed. Construction of a palace building was started in April 1874 and completed by 1878. Mr. Cameron of Lalbagh did the landscaping.
        Many additions and improvements were carried out in subsequent years. In the later years, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar added some portions outside of Durbar Hall e.g. the twin external staircase and platform for musicians.[1]
        The palace has a floor area of 45,000 sft, and grounds of 454 acres (183 ha).[2]
        The sprawling grounds surrounding the Palace is used for holding public events including music concerts
        The palace was built in Tudor Revival style architecture with fortified towers, battlements and turrets. The interiors were decorated with elegant wood carvings, floral motifs, cornices and relief paintings on the ceiling. The furniture, which was neo-classical, Victorian and Edwardian in style, was bought from John Roberts and Lazarus.
        
        The upkeep of the gardens was the responsibility of the horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel.
        
        A total of 35 rooms were built in the palace with most of them being bedrooms and a swimming pool.[2] The renovation included addition of stained glass and mirrors, specially imported from England, besides a manual lift and wooden fans from General Electric.[3]</p>
