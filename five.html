    <p> Namma Metro ("Our Metro" in Kannada), also known as Bangalore Metro or Bengaluru Metro, is a rapid transit system serving the city of Bengaluru, India. Upon its inauguration, it became the first metro system in South India.[5] It is the 3rd longest metro system in India after Delhi Metro and Hyderabad Metro. Namma Metro has a mix of underground, at grade, and elevated stations. The system runs on standard-gauge tracks.

        Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a joint venture of Government of India and the State Government of Karnataka, is the agency for building, operating and expanding the Namma Metro network.[6] Services operate daily between 05:00 and 23:00 running with a headway varying between 4â€“20 minutes.[7] The trains initially began with three coaches but were later converted to six coaches as ridership grew.[8] Power is supplied by 750 volt direct current through third rail. As of January 2020, the metro system had an average daily ridership of about 5,18,000 passengers. </p>
