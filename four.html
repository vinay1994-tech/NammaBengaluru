    <p>The Shivoham Shiva Temple, situated at Old Airport Road, Bangalore, India was built in 1995. It features a Shiva statue that is 65 feet (20 m) tall idol. It is a famous Shiva Temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva and a popular spiritual destination. It is estimated that over 500,000 devotees and visitors come to this temple every year. On the occasion of Maha Shivaratri, between 100,000 and 150,000 devotees visit the temple every year. In the first six months of 2018, the temple has already been visited by 275,909 people.
        The Shivoham Shiva Temple was formerly known as the Shiv Mandir. It is said to be built in 1995 after the founder of the temple had a vision of a temple where a gigantic statue of Lord Shiva would stand tall as a towering symbol of hope, spreading faith for generations to come. The idol of Lord Shiva was created by the sculptor Kashinath. It is also believed to have been built without using a blueprint or plan or a measuring tape. The temple was consecrated by Sri Shankaracharya of Sringeri on 26 February 1995. The Shivoham Shiva Temple was renamed from its former name Shiv Mandir in 2016 when the focus of the temple shifted to help people attain Moksha by understanding the principles in ancient vedic texts.
